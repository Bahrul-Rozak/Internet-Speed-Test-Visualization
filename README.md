**Description**: This program uses the `speedtest-cli` library to measure the user's internet speed and `matplotlib` to display a graph of the measurement results. The program will measure the download and upload speeds of the user's internet connection 5 times, then display a graph showing the speed changes from each measurement. This graph helps users to see how stable their internet speed is over the testing period.

**Purpose**: This program is useful for providing visual information about the user's internet speed and allows users to see changes in internet speed over time.
